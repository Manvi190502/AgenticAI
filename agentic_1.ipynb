What is a \"Prompt\"?**\\nA \"prompt\" is simply the **instruction or question you give to that AI assistant.**\\n*   \"Write a poem about cats.\"\\n*   \"Summarize this article.\"\\n*   \"Explain quantum physics in simple terms.\"\\n\\n**2. What is \"Engineering\" in this context?**\\nIt\\'s not about building bridges! Here, \"engineering\" means **designing, refining, and optimizing something to get the best possible outcome.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**So, Prompt Engineering is:**\\n\\nIt\\'s the **art and science of crafting the best possible instructions (prompts) for an AI to get the best possible results.**\\n\\nThink of it like this:\\n\\n*   **Simple Prompt:** \"Make food.\" (The AI might give you a very generic recipe, or ask for more details.)\\n*   **Engineered Prompt:** \"As a Michelin-star chef, create a recipe for a gourmet, vegetarian pasta dish that can be prepared in under 30 minutes. The recipe should serve two people, include a list of ingredients with exact quantities, and step-by-step instructions. The tone should be sophisticated yet easy to follow.\" (Now the AI knows exactly what you want and can deliver a much better, more specific result.)\\n\\n**Why is it important?**\\n\\n1.  **AI isn\\'t a mind-reader:** It doesn\\'t inherently know what you want. The clearer and more specific you are, the better it can perform.\\n2.  **Unlock AI\\'s full potential:** A well-engineered prompt can make the AI do amazing, complex tasks that a simple prompt wouldn\\'t achieve.\\n3.  **Save time and effort:** Getting the right answer the first time means less back-and-forth with the AI.\\n4.  **Avoid \"garbage in, garbage out\":** If your instructions are vague or poor, the AI\\'s output will likely be vague or poor.\\n\\nIn short, **prompt engineering is about learning how to \"talk\" to AI effectively so it understands your needs perfectly and gives you exactly what you\\'re looking for.**' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'} id='lc_run--019bb1b7-d0b3-7981-841f-48c833f61275-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8, 'output_tokens': 1380, 'total_tokens': 1388, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 914}}\n"
