            "This beginner's guide explains what AI agents are , how they differ from traditional automation and chatbots, and why they are becoming essential for businesses. An AI agent is a software component that has the agency to act on behalf of a user or a system to perform tasks. Users can organize agents into systems that can orchestrate complex workflows, coordinate activities among multiple agents , apply logic to thorny problems, and evaluate answers to user queries. Learn the main types of AI agents , how they work, and when to use each model, from simple reflex agents to learning and goal-based agents . Discover 2026's best AI agents . Compare frameworks, no-code tools, enterprise platforms, and get step-by-step guidance to choose and deploy agentic automation. An artificial intelligence ( AI ) agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data and use that data to perform self-directed tasks that meet predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. For example, consider a customer support AI agent that wants to resolve customer ...\n"
